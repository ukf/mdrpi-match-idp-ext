Shibboleth IdP MDRPI Filter Extension
=============================================

This plugin interprets metadata specified by the SAML V2.0 Metadata Extensions for
Registration and Publication Information Version 1.0 (MDRPI) extension specification.
It enables the identity provider to include a requesting entity's registrationAuthority
attribute in attribute release policies.

Requirements
=============================================

This plugin was developed for v2.4.x of the Shibboleth identity provider.
It may function on earlier releases in the v2.x series, but this is not supported.


Installation/Upgrade Instructions
=============================================

You can download ZIP and compressed TAR versions of this package from the
project's GitHub releases page:

    https://github.com/ukf/mdrpi-match-idp-ext/releases
    
The artifacts are signed using one of the developers' PGP keys, available
from the public key servers or from the following location:

    https://raw.github.com/ukf/mdrpi-match-idp-ext/master/doc/PGP_KEYS.asc
    
DO NOT use the copy of this file included within the package to validate
the package.

The following steps must be performed during the initial installation of this
plugin and at every IdP upgrade.

1. Shutdown the container running the IdP.

2. Place the mdrpi-match-idp-ext JAR file, located in this bundle, in to the 
   IdP distribution's lib directory
   
3. Run the IdP's install script

4. Configure the plugin as described below.  This step is only performed
   during initial installation.

5. Restart the container running the IdP

Configuration Instructions
=============================================

The following changes to the IdP's attribute-filter.xml configuration file 
only need to be performed the first time you install the plugin, after that they 
will carry over through upgrades.

1. Add the following namespace declaration to the root AttributeFilterPolicyGroup element:
   xmlns:mdrpif="http://ukfederation.org.uk/schemas/mdrpi/filter"

2. Add the following schema locations to the existing whitespace-separated list:
   http://ukfederation.org.uk/schemas/mdrpi/filter classpath:/schema/mdrpi-attribute-filter.xsd

3. Match a relying party's registrationAuthority value using a rule of type
   xsi:type="mdrpif:AttributeRequesterRegistrationAuthority"

   * Include a "registrars" attribute containing a space-separated list of one or more
     registrationAuthority values to match.
   
   * Optionally, include a "matchIfMetadataSilent" attribute to specify whether an "anonymous"
     service provider, or one lacking a registrationAuthority, should result in a match.
     The default value is "false".

Configuration Examples
=============================================

A match against the relying party's registration authority will most often be used as part of
a PolicyRequirementRule. For example, the following policy would be enabled for all entities
registered by the UK federation:

    <AttributeFilterPolicy id="regauth.ukf">
        <PolicyRequirementRule xsi:type="mdrpif:AttributeRequesterRegistrationAuthority"
            registrars="http://ukfederation.org.uk"/>

        ... attribute rules here ...
        
    </AttributeFilterPolicy>

In this next example, the policy will be active for any entities registered by either of the
registration authorities listed; note the space-separated list of URIs to match against:

    <AttributeFilterPolicy id="regauth.one.or.two">
        <PolicyRequirementRule xsi:type="mdrpif:AttributeRequesterRegistrationAuthority"
            registrars="http://federation1.org http://federation2.org"/>

        ... attribute rules here ...
        
    </AttributeFilterPolicy>

The following example demonstrates a policy which will be active for all entities registered
by a registration authority *other than* the UK federation:

    <AttributeFilterPolicy id="regauth.not.ukf">
        <PolicyRequirementRule xsi:type="basic:NOT">
            <basic:Rule xsi:type="mdrpif:AttributeRequesterRegistrationAuthority"
                registrars="http://ukfederation.org.uk"/>
        </PolicyRequirementRule>

        ... attribute rules here ...
        
    </AttributeFilterPolicy>

It can also be useful to match the relying party's registration authority in the
context of an AttributeRule, as in the following example:

    <AttributeFilterPolicy id="attr.by.regauth">
        ... policy requirement rule here ...
        
        <AttributeRule attributeID="eduPersonTargetedID">
            <PermitValueRule xsi:type="xsi:type="mdrpif:AttributeRequesterRegistrationAuthority"
                registrars="http://ukfederation.org.uk"/>
        </AttributeRule>
            
    </AttributeFilterPolicy>
    
In this case, the registration authority match applies only to the release of
the eduPersonTargetedID attribute: all values of the attribute will be
released to entities registered by the UK federation, subject to the
overall policy requirement rule in force.
